Convolutional Autoencoder for Loop Closure. A fast deep learning architecture for robust SLAM loop closure, or any other place recognition tasks.

This repo is separated into two modules. TrainAndTest for training and testing models, and DeepLCD, which is a C++ library for online loop closure or image retrieval. See their respective READMEs for details.
