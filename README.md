Convolutional Autoencoder for Loop Closure. A fast deep learning architecture for robust SLAM loop closure, or any other place recognition tasks. Download our pre-trained model with `./DeepLCD/get_model.sh`, or train your own!

This repo is separated into two modules. TrainAndTest for training and testing models, and DeepLCD, which is a C++ library for online loop closure or image retrieval. See their respective READMEs for details.
